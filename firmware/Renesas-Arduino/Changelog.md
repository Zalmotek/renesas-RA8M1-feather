# Changelog
This document keeps track of the changes that were made when porting the Arduino-Renesas Core to e2studio.

## Project structure
The original Arduino-Renesas Core project is composed of the following directories:

- [bootloaders](#bootloaders)
- [cores](#cores)
- [debugger](#debugger)
- [drivers](#drivers)
- [extras](#extras)
- [libraries](#libraries)
- [svd](#svd)
- [variants](#variants)

To keep projects clean these folders were added to a `core` directory. This way, inside the src folder of an e2studio project you should have the following directories:
- core
- libraries
    - Note that this is different from the libraries directory found inside the core folder
- SEGGER_RTT
    - Enables communication through the debugger using RTT
- common_utils.h 
    - Adds some good to have libraries and sets up an easier way to use the RTT interface
- hal_entry.cpp
    - Code written here does not execute
- handler_thread_entry.cpp
    - This thread sets up the board at boot time. It corresponds to the cores/arduino/main.cpp file
    - In the original Arduino-Renesas Core project the Interrupte Request Vector Table was stored at a specific address inside the stack. To maintain the dynamic nature of the FreeRTOS project and to avoid messing with the linker file this table is set somewhere in memory. ðŸ”´***DANGER! This might lead to undefined behaviour.*** For now this seems to be the only way that allows the board to run.
- main_thread_entry.cpp
    - This thread is the "main function" of your program. Your code goes here

### bootloaders
This directory holds the bootloaders for the Renesas based boards in the form of hex files. 

 - v1.0 - removed

### cores
This directory holds the arduino folder in which many classic Arduino functionalities are being implmented. Inside the arduino folder there are the following directories and files:
- api 
    - v1.0 changes
        - Inside the deprecated-avr-comp/avr directory created dtostrf.c file based on the dtostrf.c.impl
        - Due to Windows being non-case sensitive String.h and String.cpp were renamed to String_.h and String_.cpp such that it won't be confused with the C++ string.h library. Consequently the include paths were slightly changed.
        - Inside the Common.h file commented the definition of the init function, the weak deifinition of the main function, and the setup and loop functions. 
- cm_backtrace
    - This directory contains the ARM Cortex-M series MCU error tracking library. For now this library is deemed unnecessary.
    - v1.0 - removed
- tinyusb
    - This directory contains files that redirect to the extras/tinyusb directory. For now this directory is deemed unnecessary.
    - v1.0 - removed
- usb
    - This directory contains the defintion of the Serial USB interface. This is heavily reliant on the Tiny USB project.
    - v1.0 changes
        - Modified the include paths to the Tiny USB files, making them relative
        - Due to the RA8M1 register structure the instruction BOOT_DOUBLE_TAP_DATA = DOUBLE_TAP_MAGIC; which saves some data to the backup registers needed to be rewritten in a more explicit manner.
- analog.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - Added a reference to IRQManager.h header file
        - Changed the ADC_Container constructor by modifying the extended config trigger and vref control
- Arduino.h
    - v1.0 changes
        - Added a reference to the common_utils.h header file
        - Added a defintion of the CPU clock frequency
        - Due to the RA8M1 register structure the instruction BOOT_DOUBLE_TAP_DATA = DOUBLE_TAP_MAGIC; which saves some data to the backup registers needed to be rewritten in a more explicit manner.
- boot.h
    - v1.0 changes
        - Commented the definitions of the BOOT_DOUBLE_TAP_DATA and DOUBLE_TAP_MAGIC as they are incompatible with the RA8M1 register structure
- cortex_handlers.c
    - Functionality used by cm_backtrace
    - v1.0 removed
- dac.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - In case the analogWrite value is too big it now fixes it to (1 << analogWriteResolution()) - 1 instead of (1 << analogWriteResolution). If the maximum value is set to (1 << analogWriteResolution()) it overflows and sets the pin to 0V.
- FspLinkIrq.h
    - v1.0 changes
        - Added an explicit relative path when including elc_defines.h header file
- FspTimer.h
    - v1.0 changes
        - Include the sync.h header file
        - Inside the AGTimer constructor set the cfg to the g_timer0_cfg and the ctrl to g_timer0_ctrl defined by the AGT stack. ðŸ”´***Problematic if another AGT Stack is added.***
        - Inside the GPTimer constructor, depending on the cfg channel, set the cfg and ctrl to the coresponding g_timer_cfg and g_timer_ctrl defined by the GPT stack. Ignored the constructor extended config as it appears to break PWM functionality. ðŸ”´***Problematic if another GPT Stack is added.***
        - Inside the set_duty_cycle function added the R_GPT_RESET command to force a reset of the timer
- FspTransfer.h
    - v1.0 removed
- Interrupts.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - Removed some redundant includes
- IRQManager.cpp
    - v1.0 changes 
        - Removed some redundant includes
        - Changed the sci_uart interrupts and variables to their sci_b_uart counterparts 
        - Changed the spi interrupts and variables to their spi_b counterparts
        - Commented the I2C slave and I2C SCI master code 
        - Commented the SCI SPI code 
- IRQManager.h
    - v1.0 changes
        - Made the includes more specific and relative
        - Commented the HAS_DMAC define
        - Changed the sci_uart interrupts and variables to their sci_b_uart counterparts 
        - Changed the spi interrupts and variables to their spi_b counterparts
        - Commented I2C slave and I2C SCI master code
        - Commented the SCI SPI code 
- main.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - The purpose of this file is to setup the board and so was moved to its own thread. The code can be found in the handler thread
- pinDefinitions.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - Removed some redundant includes
- Serial.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - Changed the FSP SCI UART functions to SCI B UART functions and the SCI UART configuration variables to SCI B UART configuration variables
        - Due to the register structure of the RA8M1 SSR_b->TEND was replaced with CSR_b->TEND
    - v1.1 changes
        - Inside the begin function added a check to determine the current channel and set the cfg and the ctrl defined by the UART stack. 
- Serial.h
    - v1.0 changes
        - Removed some redundant includes
        - Changed the SCI UART configuration variables to SCI B UART configuration variables
- time.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - Removed the static keyword from the timer_micros_callback function
        - Removed Azure RTOS checks
        - Changed R_AGT0->AGT to R_AGT0->AGT16.AGT
- vector_table.c
    - v1.0 changes
        - Changed some aspects of the old initialisation of the vector table and interrupt event_link_select. These are not used and should have no impact.
        - Explicitly set the g_interrupt_event_link_select vector to (bsp_interrupt_event_t)0
- WMath.cpp
    - v1.0 changes
        - Added a reference to the api/Common.h header file
        - Removed UNO R4 and Portenta specific implementation of true random number generators
